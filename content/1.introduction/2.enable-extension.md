In that case we need custom selectors from your theme to make our extension perfect for you. You can easily put those selectors on extension settings or contact us at <a href="mailto:info@daisssydiffussion.com">info@daisssydiffussion.com</a> and our development will upload those selectors within 30 minutes.
