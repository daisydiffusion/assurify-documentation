# Shipping protection pricing

If you have already completed the onboarding process, we have created a **Shipping protection product** for you, which includes **100 SKUs**.

By default, the shipping protection is set to a **Dynamic** price of 2.5% of the subtotal. You can adjust the shipping protection price in the app to be either **Static** or **Dynamic** based on the total item price.

## Static Pricing

When you set static pricing, the shipping protection fee will be determined by your input. You can specify multiple price ranges for more precise pricing. If you skip any amounts, the shipping protection fee will not be visible within those ranges.

**For example, you can set:**

- From $0 to $10: Protection Fee $1
- From $11 to $30: Protection Fee $2
- ...
- From $10,000 to $99,999: Protection Fee $1,000

## Dynamic Pricing
Setting a dynamic price is straightforward. Simply enter a Protection Fee (e.g., 2.5 for 2.5%), along with a Minimum Protection Price and a Maximum Protection Price. Based on your minimum and maximum pricing, we will generate 100 dynamic SKUs.
